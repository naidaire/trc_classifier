-------
**Follow-up answer**
For our multi-tenant core FactSet offering, we obfuscate (data stores are proprietary) but do not encrypt the data.  Data is only useable to the application layers, raw data on disk is in a proprietary, binary form and is not discernable to any party except the application layer itself which uses an abstraction to get access to client content after authentication and authorization.
 
FactSet offers ARE (at-rest encryption) for single-tenancy services such as Vermilion, BISAM B-One, Cymba OMS, Code:Red RMS and Partners RMS - but not for our core FactSet research, portfolio management and analytics platform.
---------
**Follow-up answer**
Data are stored in secure locations within FactSet's datacenters and are therefore not encrypted at rest.  Data are stored on isolated client directories in the storage subsystem.  All storage is localized to secure locations within FactSet’s datacenters, in a proprietary database format.

FactSet works on all available Windows operating systems ranging from desktop (Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10) to server (2008 R2, 2012, 2012 R2)  If you’re running on XenApp 6 or higher, you will be using Windows Server 2008R2.  FactSet also suggest using a 2008R2 file server for your network mappings in order to leverage the performance of SMBv2.  FactSet also supports Office 2003, 2007, 2010 and 2013 – as our addins integrate with Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote.
 
FactSet is written mostly in C++ along with some .NET – there are no Java dependencies.   FactSet requires .NET 4.5.2, 4.6, 4.6.1, or 4.6.2.
 
Best practices is to upgrade the MSI once per year – which is very straightforward on a XenApp farm.  FactSet ensures that installations stay optimal intra-Framework.

This tool manages both the data loads and the SQL schemas.

The datasets can also be made available for any client written or 3rd party commercial ETL to take in the content and perform dataloads into whatever SQL/NoSQL container the client wishes.

Sophisticated orchestration and dependency analysis systems with appropriate programmatic alerting and escalation ensure that 24/7 production runstreams are running efficiently, on-time and with accurate data output.  100,000s of unit tests and regression tests are performed in-line and are part of the process path.   The use of MPP (massive parallel processing) systems to break down jobs into hundreds or thousands of pieces allows us to take computationally-expensive pieces of any sophisticated runstream and tailor the wall-time to our clients’ delivery needs.  All changes to Client Production is analyzed by our Portfolio Services Process Engineers for potential process integrity, timeliness & data ramifications before being put into queue for production release.  FactSet engineering is continually performing capacity planning, resource utilization and dependency-tree analysis of the 100,000s of jobs which run each day.

General answer: 
There have been no instances of client-wide downtime or unavailability.  Subsystems within FactSet may, from time to time, experience variation in performance due to a multitude of issues within and outside our control – however our engineers are monitoring systems 24/7 and are constantly looking for ways to deliver increased performance and robustness of our platform to our global client base.  Any events impacting clients or subsets of clients are available via FactSet Notify https://notify.factset.com, our message broadcast system.

Detailed answer: 
Over the course of the past 18 months FactSet has been completely replacing our core production network – with work being performed most weekends without incident.  Within the past quarter, we had an unplanned datacenter going offline for a space of a few hours due to human error in the procedure of decommissioning a specific switch from the legacy core network (clients were migrated to other datacenter for duration).  Our critical process was invoked and appropriate personnel followed SOPs to remediate the situation and evaluate impact, as well as perform post-mortem to understand root-causes and put controls/protections in place against future incidents of the same type.  Please note that FactSet operates two parallel live datacenters and so clients were able to logon within a short period of time of the commencement of the unplanned datacenter outage.",8/9/2017,LCW,

,What is your company’s infrastructure lifecycle management methodology and philosophy?  Include any relevant details around an upgrade or patch scenario.,"With over 1,200 engineers – FactSet is continually and rapidly evolving infrastructure for performance, speed, and functionality.   With isolated production, staging and development infrastructures – FactSet ensures separation of production work from non-production work.  100% uptime and consistent performance is the prime mandate of production.  With two live, hot datacenters each running at 40% of capacity or less, the loss of single datacenter for planned (core network, SAN, etc.) maintenance or unplanned outages is not intended to impact our ability to deliver on interactive and batch production cycles.

New technology deployment paradigms include a gradual parallel approach – deploy new technology, enable in shadow mode and machine compare with existing primary, shadow and machine compare with new primary, new primary only with existing in standby, decommission existing.
